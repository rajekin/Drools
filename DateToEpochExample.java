Subject: Teams Testing Older Version â€“ Please Validate Against Latest v1.1

Hi [Lead's Name],

I wanted to bring to your attention that some of the teams are currently testing against an older version of the service. A few individuals have reached out to me regarding discrepancies that are actually addressed in version 1.1, which is already deployed and available in the test environment.

Could you please help communicate to the respective testing teams to ensure they validate against the latest v1.1 version?
