Discrepancy in Example 10 â€“ Ineligible Card Order Due to Relationship

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I noticed that Example 10, which flags the requestor as ineligible to order a card due to an invalid relationship, does not appear to align with the current decision model logic. In the provided payload, the requestor has a relationship of "POD_PRIMARY_OWNER", which is not listed among the ineligible relationship types in the model.

Could you please review this scenario and confirm whether the example or the model needs to be updated?
