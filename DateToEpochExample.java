IBM ODM is designed to evaluate business rules and decisions based on well-defined inputs, not to validate or sanitize data. Data validation should be handled at earlier stages of the process, such as in the client application, API layer, or middleware, where the data is received and processed. This keeps ODM focused on its primary responsibility: making decisions based on valid data.

By placing validation logic in ODM, we are mixing concerns (data validation and business logic), which can lead to a more complex and harder-to-maintain system.


    ODM itself is not designed to manage HTTP protocols or handle errors like 400 (Bad Request). Instead, ODM should work under the assumption that valid data has been passed to it. If the data is invalid or incomplete, the surrounding system (such as API gateways or input validation services) should handle those issues and return appropriate HTTP responses (e.g., 400 errors).

Sending a 400 response from ODM may confuse the boundaries of responsibility in the system and make error tracing and debugging more difficult. The service layer that interacts with ODM should handle communication, validations, and HTTP responses, and ODM should only return its decision or result based on valid inputs.
