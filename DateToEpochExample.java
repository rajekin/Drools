Hey Chaitanya,

Thanks for the update. Just had a quick question — since we’re the primary users of the V9 Test DC, how are we usually informed about changes like the SAT to ATL migration?

It’s a bit confusing right now since Test is on SAT and Prod is on ATL. We only became aware of the issue after the system was already down on our end. It would be helpful to understand how these updates are communicated — or if there’s a better way we can stay in the loop going forward.

Also, how can we avoid unnecessary back and forth during these situations? A quick heads-up or centralized update could help a lot with reducing delays and confusion on both sides.

Appreciate your thoughts on this!
