Subject: Rule Coverage One-Pager for Review

Hi [Manager's Name],

I wanted to share a one-pager summarizing a new capability we’ve implemented around rule coverage reporting for our decision services.

This document outlines the core problem we’ve addressed—unused or outdated rules adding unnecessary complexity—and explains how our solution provides visibility into rule execution. It also highlights the business value, including improved clarity, faster decision-making, and more efficient testing and maintenance.

I believe this could be a valuable discussion point for optimizing our current rule sets and aligning better with business priorities.

Please find the attached document for your review. I’d be happy to walk you through it or discuss next steps.

Best regards,
