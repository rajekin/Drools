Hi Marilyn,

Thank you for your message.

The BRMS team does not have ownership of the environment setup, including the Test RES. As such, we are not authorized to deploy any rulesets to the Test RES without the appropriate approvals. For assistance with both the production readiness and any test environment validation, Nathan Marr would be the appropriate point of contact.
