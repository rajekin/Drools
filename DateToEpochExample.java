I wanted to share that we are ensuring adherence to best practices and standards in our API implementations. Specifically, we are addressing unnecessary data transfer in API responses by ensuring that responses only include meaningful information rather than echoing the entire request.

I have already raised this concern with [Recipient's Name/Team] to optimize the response structure and improve performance. Please find the forwarded email below for reference.

Let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions.
