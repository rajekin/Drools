I noticed that the Applied Date field mentioned in the wiki is inconsistent across different sections. In some places, it includes the timestamp, and in other places, it only has the date without the timestamp.

To avoid confusion and ensure consistency, can we please update the wiki to follow a single standard format for Applied Date? Ideally, it should either always include the timestamp or just the date â€” whichever is appropriate for our use case.
