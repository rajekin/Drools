Discussion with Justin Fleer on Business Rule Validation and v9 Capabilities

Hi Brian,

I had a chance to connect with Justin Fleer recently. We discussed how we could introduce business validation rules to flag and return error messages when required attributes or conditions are not met in the incoming requests.

Justin acknowledged that it's the source system’s responsibility to comply with the contract and ensure all required attributes are included before sending data to the ODM. I also shared that we can implement negative test scenarios to observe how the system behaves—for instance, what happens when required attributes are missing from the request.

Additionally, I asked Justin if they are currently leveraging Snowflake data. I took the opportunity to explain some of the features introduced in version 9, particularly the support for running PMML models, and inquired if they have any use cases that could benefit from this capability.

Let me know if you'd like to sync further on this.
