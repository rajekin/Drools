Thanks for bringing this up.

The version you're currently testing appears to be outdated. The change to include 4 whitespaces for statementFields was introduced as part of an updated requirement and has been incorporated in version 1.1, which is now available in the test environment.

Please make sure youâ€™re testing against v1.1 to validate the latest behavior.
