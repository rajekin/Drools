Hi Nathan,

Thank you for setting up the wiki to document security group assignments.

However, I wanted to share some concerns. The process you've outlined is manual and slows down the overall BRMS lifecycle. v9 Decision Center already provides an automated way to assign groups to projects, and any audit requirements can be addressed using built-in Decision Center reports.

Rather than relying on external documentation, we should focus on automation and on fully leveraging the capabilities of ODM. At this point, we're not utilizing several key features that are designed to streamline governance and reduce manual intervention.

Additionally, the responsibility of managing publishing and group assignments should ideally lie with the system administratorâ€”not with developers. Right now, we are dependent on you to enable publishing whenever a new Decision Service is promoted to a region, which introduces unnecessary delays.

To align on a more efficient and scalable approach, could you please schedule a meeting with Dave, Brian, Rob, and yourself at the earliest convenience?
