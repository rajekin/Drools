Modeling Recommendation:

The transition leading to "Add Invalid Holds" should originate from the branch (decision) node, not directly from the "Add Valid Holds" rule task. This ensures logical clarity in the flow and accurately represents the decision logic being evaluated at the branch node. Connecting transitions from the decision node also improves maintainability and aligns with standard modeling best practices.
