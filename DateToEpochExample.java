Certification Process Summary:

Executed end-to-end Decision Center testing in both environments.

Verified the rules execution sequence and confirmed consistency across versions.

Conducted API-level validation using the defined JSON payloads.

Captured and compared processing times and assertion results across regions.

All test artifacts, including execution logs, performance comparisons, and assertion results, are attached for your reference.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details.
