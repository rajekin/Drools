Hi Brian,

Thank you for your note.

We did maintain a log of these issues in the past, but it proved to be of limited value as it didn’t lead to actionable outcomes or help prevent recurrence. Given that, we eventually discontinued it.

That said, I believe it's primarily the responsibility of the system administration team to monitor and maintain the health of the test regions. They are better positioned to track uptime, response metrics, and report systemic issues proactively.

Happy to collaborate if there’s a broader solution being considered, but just wanted to clarify the historical context and roles.
