Include Testers in Analyst/IT Meetings

Hi Team,

Going forward, please make sure to include our testers in any meetings or discussions involving Analysts or IT teams. Their involvement early on will help ensure better understanding of requirements, clarify expectations, and catch potential issues upfront.

Letâ€™s make this a standard practice to improve collaboration and efficiency across teams.

Thank you!
