Hi Jonathan,

I may not be able to attend the upcoming meeting as I’m currently focused on completing my V9 certification.

In my absence, please ensure the following points are clearly communicated:

Test Coverage: Emphasize the breadth of our validation, including positive, negative, and boundary scenarios aligned with DARE rule requirements.

Scenario Development: Highlight how we structure scenarios around business rules, conditions, and expected outcomes, ensuring traceability back to rule logic.

API Testing Focus: Please place additional focus on the API layer—we validate payloads, response codes, error handling, and end-to-end decision execution via APIs.

This meeting may extend beyond just reviewing test scenarios, so feel free to cover team responsibilities and overall testing strategy as needed.
