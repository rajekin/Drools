Ruchi is a mid-to-senior-level developer with strong expertise in ODM and Decision Center testing. She has solid communication skills and handles complex projects well. While she excels in Decision Center testing, she needs improvement in Java (specifically writing Java 8 method formats) and API testing (particularly in writing assertions in Postman). To support her growth, we plan to have her focus on improving her Java skills and API testing in Postman to strengthen her overall technical proficiency.
