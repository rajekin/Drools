Subject: Clarification on New Attributes in DAX BPE System Wiki

Hi [POC's Name],

I noticed that two new attributes – stylingType and isJointProduct – have been added to the DAX Bank Product Eligibility (BPE) system wiki. However, we do not currently see them reflected in the 3.1 version of the model, which we are actively working on.

Could you please confirm which version these attributes are intended to be part of
