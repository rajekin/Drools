Hi Team,

As V9 ODM RES is now available in TEST, we will be proceeding with development of all in-progress applications directly in V9.

Could you please assess and let me know what it would take to move all in-progress applications to V9â€”including any effort, dependencies, or potential risks?

Thank you,
