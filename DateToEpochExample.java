Subject: Opportunity to Support Migration Issue Reported on JRules Slack Channel

Hi [Manager's Name],

I noticed a post on the JRules Slack channel from Ranjith Thirumoorthi regarding an "Undefined identifier" error in Rule Designer 8.11 after migrating a rule project. I responded to his query, and it seems they need hands-on support to resolve the issue.

Our team has the required technical expertise in this area, especially around project structure changes in 8.11 and proper BOM setup. I believe we can assist them effectively and add value here.

Please let me know if youâ€™d like me to reach out formally or proceed with offering our support.

Thanks,
Raj
