Hi Aisha,

Business owners do not require access to the RES URLâ€”this is primarily needed by the IT teams to perform decision testing.

The Rule Execution Server (RES) is composed of two parts: the RES Console and the RES Runtime. The console allows users to view the deployed ruleapp, review its properties, and perform basic testing. In contrast, the runtime is a scalable environment used to actually execute the ruleapp.

Our team currently does not have access to the runtime, which is what should be used by the application teams to invoke decisions.
