Hi Dave,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Below are my responses to your queries and clarification on how this document differs from the testing performed in Decision Center:

Primary Reason for the Document:
The primary aim of this document is to establish a clear understanding of testing practices within the ADLC framework. Specifically, it emphasizes the role of unit testing in ensuring decisions are reliable and align with organizational standards.

Distinction from Testing in Decision Center:
The testing described here (unit testing using JUnit and API validation using Postman) differs significantly from the functional or rule-based testing typically performed in Decision Center. In Decision Center:

Testing is centered on validating business rules and decision outcomes against expected results.
It ensures that decision tables and rule logic meet business requirements, focusing on the accuracy of the decisions generated by the rules.
By contrast, the unit testing mentioned in the document focuses on technical aspects:

JUnit validates Java-related objects, ensuring the underlying logic and calculations are accurate.
Postman validates APIs, ensuring seamless communication between system components.
Cornerstone of Testing for Our Decisions:
Yes, unit testing, as outlined in the document, is intended to be a cornerstone. It provides a foundation to validate and verify that the decisions made within the ADLC are logical, consistent, and error-free.

Responsibility of Testing:
This document outlines the responsibilities for developers to test technical aspects of their implementations before they integrate with business rule validation in Decision Center.
