Dear WAH_ASSETMGMT,

I received my new laptop on July 2nd around 5:00 PM ET. I was out of office on July 3rd, and with the July 4th holiday and long weekend, I was out of town through July 7th.

After returning and seeing this email, I immediately dropped off my old laptop. I did not copy any files from the old device — I had already started setting up my new workspace on the replacement laptop.

I’m unclear on the reason for the escalation, given the timing and circumstances. Also, I’d like to understand when employees are expected to transfer files or complete backups — especially when the replacement device arrives just before a holiday or planned time off.

Please let me know if further action is needed from my side.
