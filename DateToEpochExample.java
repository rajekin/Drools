Hi Sarah,

Thank you for following up.

At this time, we haven’t prioritized the DARE rules migration to the v9 test environment, as we are still awaiting confirmation that the production environment is fully ready to support this transition. Once we have clarity on the production readiness, we will be in a better position to define a timeline and allocate effort accordingly.

I’ll keep you posted as soon as we have more concrete updates.

Best regards,
Raj
