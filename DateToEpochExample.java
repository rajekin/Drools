Core Working Hours & Team Availability Reminder

Body:

Hi Team,

Hope you're all doing well!

Just a quick reminder about our core working hours — while we do offer flexibility in our schedules, it’s important that we stay aligned and available during our key collaborative hours.

If you need to step away from your desk for more than 20 minutes, please drop a quick message in the team chat or update your status, so everyone is aware and can plan accordingly. This helps avoid blockers and ensures smooth communication across the team.

Let’s continue maintaining that great balance of flexibility and accountability. Thanks for your cooperation!
