Thank you for sharing your initial thoughts. Below are my responses to the outlined questions and considerations for defining success and progression for testers:

1. Definition of Success to Move to Level 2:
Success for Level 1 testers can be defined as achieving proficiency in:

Consistently creating accurate test cases for DM (Seen, Unseen), ODM, and BRMS processes.
Understanding the Decision Center to build, execute, and debug test cases.
Demonstrating independence in handling low-effort, low-complexity projects while receiving positive feedback during peer reviews.
2. Knowledge Required from a Product Standpoint:
To progress, testers should have foundational knowledge of:

The products and their relationship to account holders.
Test case creation and execution for both routine and scenario-based testing.
BRMS processes and ODM workflows.
APIs and their integration into testing processes.
3. Measuring Proficiency:
Proficiency in each area can be measured by:

Practical assessments (e.g., successful creation and execution of test cases).
Consistent delivery of low-complexity projects.
Feedback from Level 2/3 mentors on reviewed work.
Demonstrated problem-solving and debugging in Decision Center and related tools.
4. Project Types for Level 1 Testers:
Level 1 testers should focus on:

Low-effort, low-complexity projects such as simple scenarios in ODM or basic API integrations.
Building familiarity with tools and processes under the guidance of a mentor until they can independently deliver work with quality peer reviews.
