Escalation: Uncommunicated DAX ASG Cleanup Impacting Team Productivity

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I’m reaching out to escalate an issue we encountered today regarding an uncommunicated cleanup of the DAX ASG conducted by Nate. This cleanup resulted in several users losing access, while others experienced unexpected changes to their permissions. Due to these access issues, our team faced significant disruptions, losing an entire day of productivity as we worked to identify the affected users and coordinate necessary actions to restore access.

This situation underscores the importance of prior communication when conducting access management changes, as it enables us to prepare and mitigate any potential disruptions. I recommend setting up a process for more consistent communication around such changes in the future to prevent similar incidents.

Please let me know if you’d like more details or if I should take any further steps on this matter.

Thank you for your attention to this.
