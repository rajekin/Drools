Recommend replacing
make it false that the hold action result of 'the response' is hold action allowed ;
with the more explicit and readable form:
set the hold action allowed of the hold action result of the response to false ;

This improves clarity and aligns better with BRL best practices by explicitly referencing the object and its property, avoiding the ambiguous use of make it.
