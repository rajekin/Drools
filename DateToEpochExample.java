Update on Communication Process with Business and IT Teams

Dear Team,

I’d like to inform you of an update regarding our communication process with the business and IT teams.

Up until now, all communication — including test results and business queries — has been routed exclusively through Aisha. Moving forward, while test case results should still typically be communicated via Aisha, testers and developers are now encouraged to directly engage with business or IT teams as needed. If you are comfortable, you may respond to their questions or concerns directly.

Please note: If any of these discussions result in additional work for you or lead to a change in the direction or decisions you are currently working on, it is your responsibility to keep the team informed. Clear communication will help us stay aligned and avoid any confusion.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification.
