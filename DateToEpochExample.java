Subject: Clarification Needed on displayOrder Sequence for eSign Documents

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

While reviewing the eSign document configuration, I noticed a discrepancy between the display order in the decision model and the one documented in the wiki (see screenshot attached). The decision model uses a sequential display order, whereas the wiki defines fixed numbers for displayOrder (e.g., 1, 3, etc.).

Could you please confirm which one we should follow as the source of truth? If the decision model sequence is preferred, should we update the wiki accordinglyâ€”or vice versa?

Looking forward to your clarification so we can proceed with consistency.
