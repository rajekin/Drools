Segregation of Duties (SoD):

Assigning deployment to a team member who is not the developer ensures compliance with SoD principles, enhancing governance and reducing risk.

Consistency Across Environments:

Our team has better visibility and consistency across environments, allowing us to standardize and streamline the deployment process across all applications.

Ownership and Accountability:

If our team is accountable for the rule development and testing lifecycle, it makes operational sense for us to own deployment, allowing for end-to-end accountability.

Business Precedent:

As noted, the business team is creating changes while Nate assists with deployment. This demonstrates a functional separation â€” our team can replicate this structure with a dev and deploy pairing from within.

Reduced Bottlenecks:

Relying solely on Nate creates a single point of failure and potential bottleneck. Distributing deployment responsibility improves agility and continuity.

Familiarity with the Rule Logic:

Our team deeply understands the business rules, allowing us to validate deployments more effectively and reduce errors or rollbacks.

Process Readiness:

Although the process document isn't fully detailed, our team is aligned with the deployment swim lane in the BRMS process map and can formalize the deployment steps quickly.

Supportability & Long-Term Scale:

Empowering our team to manage deployments builds broader organizational capability and ensures sustainable scaling as volume or scope grows.
