ODM V9 Migration â€“ Okta SSO Integration Status

Hi [Manager's Name],

As part of the ODM V9 migration, I wanted to revisit the Okta SSO integration. While Okta was intended to be part of the 8.11 setup, it was never fully implemented.

Since V9 provides an opportunity to enable this properly, do you know if the system admin team has a plan or timeline for setting it up? It would help streamline access for users and align with our broader security standards.
