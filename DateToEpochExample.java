Recommendation on Naming Conventions:

Using the word "Rule" in the rule name (e.g., "Fidelity in Next Day Mode Rule") is generally not considered a best practice, as it adds redundancy and doesn’t enhance clarity. The object type is already known to be a rule based on its context or structure within the decision service. To keep naming concise and meaningful, it’s recommended to use action-oriented or descriptive phrases without suffixing them with "Rule."

Example:
Instead of "Officer Code Rule", consider just "Officer Code" or "Check Officer Code".
