Could you please confirm in which version you'd like us to include the fix for this defect? While we can provide the fix in v1.1, my recommendation is to include it in v3.0 to avoid delays and rework. This would also help us save time and streamline the development effort.

Please let us know your preference so we can plan accordingly.
