Subject: ODM v9 Decision Center â€“ Certification Paused Due to Performance Issues

Hi [Manager's Name],

I wanted to bring to your attention some critical performance issues we've encountered while certifying the ODM v9 Decision Center.

During our test execution across multiple rule projects, we observed significant UI slowness and frequent timeouts, especially while running automated test cases. This level of instability is currently impacting our ability to complete the certification reliably.

Given these challenges, we are pausing the certification effort until the performance concerns are addressed and a stable testing environment is ensured.
