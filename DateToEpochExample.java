Recently, we've observed that the absence of handover meetings after new decision models or updates to existing ones has led to delays during development. Developers and testers are spending significant time trying to understand the changes and identify issues, particularly when new attributes are introduced or multiple decision tables are modified.

To streamline the process and reduce development time, I would like to request that we reinstate the handover meetings. These meetings were valuable in ensuring smooth transitions between the business and development teams, and they allowed for early detection of any potential issues.

I suggest we hold these meetings whenever:

New decision models are introduced.
Existing decisions have new attributes added.
Multiple decision tables are updated.
Your collaboration in reinstating this practice will help improve efficiency and reduce errors during development. Please let me know your thoughts, and we can work together to ensure a smooth process moving forward.
