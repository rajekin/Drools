Request for Individual Skip-Level Meeting

Hi [Manager’s Manager’s Name],

I hope you're doing well. I understand that skip-level meetings are typically conducted at the team level, but I was hoping to request a one-on-one conversation with you if your schedule allows.

I’d really appreciate the opportunity to share some personal insights and feedback, and also to gain a better understanding of your perspective on the broader direction of the team and organization.

Please let me know if this would be possible and if there’s a convenient time in the coming weeks. I’m happy to accommodate your availability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
