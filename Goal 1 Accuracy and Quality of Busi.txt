Initially, when I committed to participating in the presentation, I fully anticipated having the necessary bandwidth to contribute effectively. However, unforeseen issues arose during the audit process that demanded more effort and attention than I initially estimated.

Upon realizing the extent of the audit's requirements and the critical nature of the situation, I promptly informed the team that I would be unable to make it to the presentation as planned. I recognized that my focus and dedication were needed to address the audit promptly and ensure that we meet our organizational obligations and mitigate any potential risks to the company.
