I am writing to formally report an incident of unprofessional conduct that occurred during a recent interaction with my manager, [Manager's Name].

On [date], during a conversation regarding [specific context], my manager used inappropriate and demeaning language by stating, "shame on you." This choice of words not only goes against the expected standards of professionalism within our workplace but also creates an uncomfortable and disrespectful atmosphere.

I believe it is crucial to bring such matters to the attention of HR to ensure a thorough investigation and appropriate resolution. I understand the importance of maintaining a positive and respectful work environment, and incidents like these should be addressed promptly.

I kindly request that you conduct a formal investigation into this matter, and if necessary, take appropriate corrective actions to prevent the recurrence of such behavior. A workplace should be a space where employees feel valued and respected, and I believe addressing incidents of unprofessional conduct is pivotal to maintaining that atmosphere.

I am willing to provide any additional information or details that may assist in the investigation. I trust that HR will handle this matter with the utmost confidentiality and sensitivity.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this serious issue. I look forward to a resolution that ensures a professional and respectful workplace for all employees.
