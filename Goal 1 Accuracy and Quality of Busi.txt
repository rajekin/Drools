Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss the recent proposal to include Protegrity tokenization for the objects passed to our ODM service. While I understand the importance of data security, I would like to highlight several concerns regarding the impact this decision may have on our current development lifecycle and overall performance.

Development Overhead: Integrating tokenization into our ODM service will introduce a significant development overhead. This process requires additional resources for configuration, testing, and maintenance, potentially slowing down the decision development lifecycle.
Performance Impact: Tokenization may affect the performance of our decision services. The additional encryption and decryption processes can introduce latency, impacting the speed at which our services respond to client requests.
Complexity in Implementation: Adding tokenization increases the complexity of our architecture. This could lead to a steeper learning curve for developers and additional time spent on troubleshooting and resolving issues.
Resource Utilization: The additional processing required for tokenization can increase the usage of system resources, impacting other areas of our operations and potentially increasing costs.
Alternative Approaches: There may be alternative methods to achieve data security that are less intrusive and complex. I recommend exploring these options before making a decision on tokenization.
Given these concerns, I believe that supporting the inclusion of Protegrity tokenization may not be the most efficient use of our resources and could hinder our current development processes. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter further and explore potential alternatives.

Thank you for considering my perspective. Please let me know a convenient time for us to discuss this in more detail.

Best regards,
