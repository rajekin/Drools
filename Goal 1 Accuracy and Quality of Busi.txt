Subject: Clarification on Adding JVM Argument for Unused Variable Issue in IBM ODM 8.11.1

Dear [IBM Support Team/Contact Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I am reaching out regarding an issue we encountered after upgrading to IBM ODM 8.11.1.

Background:
Upon upgrading to IBM ODM 8.11.1, we have encountered an issue with one of our decision services during the creation of a ruleapp. The issue stems from unused variables being flagged, specifically variables that are read but never written and vice versa. It's worth noting that the implementation of this particular decision service cannot be modified due to certain constraints.

Proposed Solution:
After consulting with IBM, we were advised to consider adding a JVM argument -Dcom.ibm.rules.engine.variablesetinspector=false as a potential solution to bypass the unused variable issue during the ruleapp creation process.

Request for Clarification:
Before proceeding with implementing this solution in our production environment, we would like to seek further clarification from your team to ensure that:

Adding the JVM argument -Dcom.ibm.rules.engine.variablesetinspector=false is indeed the recommended approach to address the unused variable issue in IBM ODM 8.11.1.
Implementing this JVM argument will not cause any adverse effects or compatibility issues with our existing decision services or the overall performance of IBM ODM.
If there are any alternative solutions or best practices that you recommend for handling unused variable issues in IBM ODM 8.11.1, especially in scenarios where the decision service implementation cannot be altered.
Additionally, we would appreciate any insights or considerations that you can provide regarding the potential impact of adding this JVM argument on our deployment environment and any related configurations.

We understand the importance of maintaining the stability and reliability of our IBM ODM environment, and we want to ensure that any changes or configurations we make align with IBM's recommended practices.

We look forward to your prompt response and guidance on this matter. If you require any further information or assistance from our end, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Thank you for your attention to this request, and we appreciate your ongoing support.

Best regards,
