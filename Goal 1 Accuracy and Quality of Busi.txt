Hello Team,

Great news on the tech front! We're diving into a significant upgrade â€“ shifting gears from ODM 8.10 to the latest and greatest, ODM 8.11! Our innovation team has been burning the midnight oil to set up a shiny new Decision Center instance and dedicated RES environments for each project.

Now, let's break it down. We've mapped out a meticulous plan documented in our wiki. Here are the detailed instructions to guide us through this seamless transition:

Migration Steps:

Project Assessment:

Conduct a thorough assessment of each project to identify dependencies and custom configurations.
Backup and Snapshot:

Prior to migration, ensure a complete backup of the current ODM 8.10 projects. Take snapshots to capture the current state.
Decision Center Migration:

Migrate projects to the new Decision Center instance. Validate the integrity of rule artifacts, decision tables, and configurations.
RES Environment Setup:

Set up dedicated RES environments for each project, ensuring compatibility with ODM 8.11.
Project Migration to RES:

Move projects to their respective RES environments. Verify connections, configurations, and dependencies.
Testing Procedures:

Functional Testing:

Execute functional tests to validate that decision-making processes remain consistent between ODM 8.10 and 8.11.
Performance Testing:

Conduct performance tests to measure the improved processing speed in ODM 8.11.
User Interface Validation:

Validate the enhanced user interface in Decision Center, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.
Communication and Collaboration:

Regularly update the team on the progress of the migration through designated communication channels.
Foster open communication channels for feedback and address any concerns promptly.
Why is this migration a game-changer? ODM 8.11 isn't just an upgrade; it's a leap forward in decision management. The improvements in performance, the sleeker interface, and streamlined decision-making processes are geared towards enhancing our efficiency and future readiness.

So, gear up for this exciting journey! Our migration is a strategic move to ensure we're not just keeping up but leading the pack in decision management.
